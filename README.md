# Auto Window Mover
### The purpose of this application is to "split" the screen, so the user can work with two windows (applications) without having to arrange them manually each time.
### The code checks if a specific text is contained within a whole window title, if the check gives true, the window will be moved.
### There are some cases when you can't see the title of a visible window, that's where the window titles in the listbox comes into use.
### The app window will start hidden but it has a notification icon to the right lower corner. If you right click and choose "Move windows", don't do it if you have not made the settings yet (otherwise ALL visible windows will be moved). Instead you should choose "Show" in the menu, and when the app window has shown up type in the titles of the windows you want to move. When you click the "Move windows"-button the settings will be saved too. Also make sure the windows are maximized, otherwise they might move too far away and you won't be able to see them.
### You might ask yourself, "what numbers should I type in?". Add any number, increase and decrease with each saving until a desired result is achieved.
